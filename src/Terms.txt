Move Pattern - The way that a chess piece can possibly move.
        Knights move in L's, etc. The legality of the move and
        the bounds of the board are not considered. Every
        possible space a piece /could/ move to is here.

Things that determine if a move is legal:
        1. The move pattern of that piece
        2. KING: Is castling allowed right now?
        3. PAWN: Is it the pawn's first move?
        4. PAWN: Is en passant allowed right now?
        5. Would the move put the king in check? (costly)

How to check if King is in check:
        

En Passant
        Only happens the very next turn after a pawn moves
        forward two spaces. Requires access to previous state
        of the board
